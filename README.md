# Construction-helmet-detection

## University project to increase risk prevention in the construction area by monitoring and recognizing the use of helmets by workers.

#### The project uses both the HAAD waterfall training system, with two main files: full_body.xml and helmet.xml . The first one was extracted from the large OpenCV database, while the second one was elaborated by the project team, through a job of obtaining negative and positive photos, in addition to selecting and transforming the useful features for the study.
